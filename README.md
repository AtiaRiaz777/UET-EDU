# UET-EDU

This is a react native application. In this app we used visual studio code to run a react native app. version detail is added below
"expo": "^36.0.0"
"react": "16.9.0"
"expo-facebook": "~8.0.0"

Our idea is to design an app that can make easy for the students and teachers to get aware from the university , department 
or class related updates.

We just added timetable of third semester and section A of third semester due to shortage of time.
